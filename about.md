I am an aspiring AI researcher currently exploring deep learning with the [Google Brain Research Group](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/) as a [Brain Resident](https://www.google.com/about/careers/search#!t=jo&jid=147545001&). I am interested in reinforcement learning and theoretical machine learning, and wish to research at the intersection of the two. I spend my time at Google working with the brain-robotics research group. 

Before joining Google, I completed my unergraduate degree from the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/) at IIT Kanpur, India. During my undergraduate, I spent a summer at [Computational and Biological Learning Lab, University of Cambridge](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) exploring shape constrained gaussian processes under the supervision of [Prof. Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/). I also worked with [Dr. Sumit Gulwani](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sumitg/) and [Prof. Amey Karkare](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/karkare/) on intelligent tutoring systems for education and translation. Find more details of my academic life from my CV.  

I am always exited to chat about AI / ML / theory. Hit me up if you are in the Bay Area and would like to meet.
